This update focuses on improving some long-standing sore points in the app. Most notably, we have overhauled the app interface for better support of right-to-left (RTL) languages. Now when the app language is set to an RTL language, the entire interface will be mirrored. We have also given a lot of attention to improving the editing and reading experience of footnotes. This release is jam-packed with bug fixes, but you might also notice some performance improvements when loading the app and while editing.

Highlights
RTL Support. The interface direction is now mirrored when the app is set to an RTL language.
Updated left sidebar layout. A new vault switcher is now shown at the bottom. The app ribbon can now be hidden in settings or by right-clicking on the ribbon and selecting "Hide ribbon."
Character and word count is now updated based on the current text selection.
Faster workspace loading.
Faster editor parsing.
